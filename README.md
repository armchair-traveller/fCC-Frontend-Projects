# fCC-Frontend-Projects

Frontend library portion of freeCodeCamp curriculum in React, merged as an SPA.  
 Additional basic configuration added for improving code quality.  
 There may be a benefit in making it all an SPA, perhaps reduced configuration overhead.

# Basic Tech Stack

- Parcel Bundler
- React: Hooks, DOM
- Reach Router - SPA stuff
- Material-UI - UI framework. Surfaces, buttons, & icons.

## Dev Tooling

- ESLint - configured for React (Hooks, JSX a11y) & Prettier.
- Prettier - formatter
- VSCode - IDE

# Quote Machine

Quotes are hard-coded in and randomized through a function.

# Markdown Previewer

Remarkable library used for markdown parsing set with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.  
I don't know what I was thinking when I was writing the initial text, but it passed the test. Don't judge.
