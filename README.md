# fCC-Frontend-Projects

Frontend library portion of freeCodeCamp curriculum in React, merged as an SPA.  
 Additional basic configuration added for improving code quality.  
 There may be a benefit in making it all an SPA, perhaps reduced configuration overhead.

# Tech Stack

- React: Hooks, DOM
- Gatsby - static site "boilerplate" magic, optimizations
- Emotion - CSS-in-JS
- Reach Router - SPA stuff: Router, Redirect
- Material-UI - UI framework. Surfaces, buttons, & icons.
